Title: LegalBench: A Collaboratively Built Benchmark for Measuring Legal Reasoning in Large Language Models

Abstract: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11462.pdf

The LegalBench project is an ongoing open science effort to collaboratively curate tasks for evaluating legal reasoning in English large language models (LLMs). The benchmark currently consists of 162 tasks gathered from 40 contributors.

### Groups and Tasks

#### Groups

* `legalbench_exact_match`: The multiple-choices tasks which are evaluated using mean accuracy.
* `legalbench_ISSUE_TASKS`: Issue-spotting tasks in which an LLM must determine if a set of facts raise a particular set of legal questions, implicate an area of the law, or are relevant to a specific party.
* `legalbench_RULE_TASKS`: Rule-recall tasks which require the LLM to generate the correct legal rule on an issue in a jurisdiction (e.g., the rule for hearsay in US federal court), or answer a question about what the law in a jurisdiction does/does not permit.
* `legalbench_CONCLUSION_TASKS`: Rule-conclusion tasks which require an LLM to determine the legal outcome of a set of facts under a specified rule.
* `legalbench_INTERPRETATION_TASKS`: Interpretation tasks which require the LLM to parse and understand a legal text (e.g., classifying contractual clauses).
* `legalbench_RHETORIC_TASKS`: Rhetorical-understanding tasks which require an LLM to reason about legal argumentation and analysis (e.g., identifying textualist arguments).
